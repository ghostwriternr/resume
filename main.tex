% %  \item[Learning to extract comparison points of entity pairs from Wikipedia articles] Worked on a novel comparative text mining task using relational tuples to model and measure semantic commonality for two given documents and tabulating them. This work was published as a poster at JCDL 2018.
%  \item[Parsing and extracting metadata from medical prescription images] Built the React frontend and Python Flask API for a medical prescription parsing software, with Tesseract for OCR.
% %  \item[Compiler for Tiny C (A tiny subset of the C language)] Built a compiler for Tiny C, a self-defined subset of the C language, using Compiler principles and techniques. The compiler itself was written in C++ with Flex and Bison for Lexical Analysis and Semantic parsing.
% %  \item[Mini Linux Shell] Implemented some features of the Linux Shell including redirection, piping and terminal mirroring using the C language.
% %  \item[Lyrics generator using Neural Networks] Wrote a lyrics generator using TensorFlow that generates a new song in an artist's style. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network learns the artists' styles of writing including words, rhymes, chorus patterns, etc. for the task.
